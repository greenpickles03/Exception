//Exception Handling in Java
Exception handling in Java is a mechanism that allows developers to manage runtime errors, ensuring the normal flow of
the application. It involves the use of keywords such as try, catch, finally, throw, and throws.
//Exception
An exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of instructions.
all exception in java is a object of the class Throwable. The Throwable class has two main subclasses: Error and Exception.
// Types of Exceptions
1. Checked Exceptions: These are exceptions that are checked at compile-time so that java force to use try and catch throws.
Examples include IOException, SQLException.
2. Unchecked Exceptions: These are exceptions that occur at runtime and are not checked at compile-time meaning
java not to force to use try and catch or throws.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Examples include NullPointerException, ArithmeticException.
3. Errors: These are serious problems that a reasonable application should not try to catch.
Examples include OutOfMemoryError, StackOverflowError.
//Exception Handling Keywords
1. try: The try block contains the code that may throw an exception.
2. catch: The catch block is used to handle the exception thrown by the try block.
3. finally: The finally block is used to execute important code such as closing resources, regardless of whether an
exception occurred or not.
4. throw: The throw keyword is used to explicitly throw an exception, usually throw is inside the method and the basic
syntax of throw is throw new ArithmeticException("Bata ka pa, bawal bumoto.");.
5. throws: The throws keyword is used in method declarations to indicate that a method may throw one or more exceptions.


START
  |
  v
 TRY block
  |
  +-- No Error --> skip catch --> go to FINALLY --> END
  |
  +-- Error Occurs -->
        |
        +-- Has matching catch? --> Execute catch --> FINALLY --> END
        |
        +-- No matching catch? --> FINALLY --> Program ends with error
